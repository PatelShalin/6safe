# Inspiration
I stumbled upon this idea by diving deeper into the third challenge of the Acorn Talents Hack which was called Smart Infrastructure.

# What it does
My regression model predicts the number of homeless people in a given year based on the data I found. These predictions would then be given to some level of governance to make appropriate decisions regarding the quantity and location of the shelters for the people.

# How I built it
I first performed data mining and profiling on data resources found online via government institutions and other reliable sources. After receiving the data, I cleaned and organized it to more accurately depict trends that I could later confirm with the help of a regression model.

# Challenges I ran into
Finding the data for homeless people was a big struggle since it is not a) recorded in general and b) released to the public. Additionally, any form of data that I happened to encounter was in a pdf or displayed as graphs in a pdf which are both equally as hard to read.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Despite the lack of data, I still pushed forward and found some reliable data that I was able to depict trends from and place into a regression model. Due to there being almost no data on the population of homeless people, I had to create a script that would generate 'fake', but not random, data which would accurately align with numerous articles based on the populations of homeless people.

# What I learned
I gained a lot of insight in what data science actually is and I also learned a lot about how to face many of the challenges that data scientists or analysts may face on a day-to-day basis.

# What's next for 6Safe
Upcoming steps include an elegant and robust full-stack website for users to view the data I found and predicted. Additionally, I would to post reports based on our findings to this website in order to inform the city of Toronto.
